REGISTER MODE:
Register a word.
One meaning can be registered for each word.
In fact, I was going to be able to register as many as I wanted.
However, the process in FIND mode was troublesome, so it became one.
I plan to change the system to allow multiple registrations in the future.
If you wish to register more than one meaning, please wait for an update to be implemented.
To use the system, enter the word you want to register in the top field, enter its meaning in the next field, and press the "Submit" button.
